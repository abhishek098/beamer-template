Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the CA3, but not the CA1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.},

@article{Doty,
	abstract = {Robokcs research has made extensive use of techniques based on me Moore-Penrose inverse, or generalized inverse, of matri-als. Recently it has been pointed out how noninvariant results may, in general, be obtained by applying these techniques to other areas of robotics, namely hybrid control and inverse ve-locity kinematics. Unfortunately, the problems are not restricted to just these particular areas in robotics but are connected with misleading definitions of the metric properties of the six-dimensional wrench and twist vector spaces used in robotics. The current definitions lead to inconsistent results (i.e., results that are not invariant with respect to changes in the reference frame andlor changes in the dimensional units used to express the problem. As a matter of fact, given a linear system u = Ax, where the matrix A may be singular, the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized inverses may be properly and directly applied only when the vector space U of vector u and the vector space X of vector x are inner product spaces. Arbitrary assignment of Euclidean inner products to the space U and X when the vectors u and x have elements with different physical units can lead to inconsistent and noninvariant results. In this article the problem of inconsistent, noninvariant solutions X s to u = Ax in robotics is briefly reviewed and a general theory for com-puting consistent, gauge-invariant solutions to nonhomogeneous systems of the form u = Ax is developed. In addition, the dual relationship between rigid-body kinematics and statics is de-fined formally as a particular, linear algebraic system whose solution system is also a dual system. Examples illustrate the theory.},

@article{Deo1995,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a tutorial report of the literature on the damped-least squares method which has been used for computing velocity inverse kinematics of robotic manipulators. This is a local optimization method that can prevent infeasible joint velocities near singular configurations by using a damping factor to control the norm of the joint velocity vector. However, the exactness of the inverse kinematic solution has to be sacrificed in order to achieve feasibility. The damping factor is an important parameter in this technique since it determines the trade-off between the accuracy and feasibility of the inverse kinematic solution. Various methods that have been proposed to compute an appropriate damping factor are described. Redundant manipulators, possessing extra degrees of freedom, afford more choice of in-verse kinematic solutions than do non-redundant ones. The damped least-squares method has been used in conjunction with redundancy resolution schemes to compute feasible joint velocities for redundant arms while performing an additional subtask. We outline the different techniques that have been proposed to achieve this objective. In addition, we introduce an iterative method to compute the optimal damping factor for one of the redundancy resolution techniques.},

This paper describes the process to generate whole body motions which can be performed by an actual biped humanoid robot. Human dance motions are acquired through a motion capturing system. We then extract symbolic representation which is made up of primitive motions: essential postures in arm motions and step primitives in leg motions. A joint angle sequence of the robot is generated according to these primitive motions. Then joint angles are modified to satisfy mechanical constraints of the robot. For balance control, the waist trajectory is moved to acquire dynamics consistency based on desired ZMP. The generated motion is tested on OpenHRP dynamics simulator. In our test, the Japanese folk dance, 'Jongara-bushi', was successfully performed by HRP-1S.},

	abstract = {Acquisition of new sensorimotor knowledge by imitation is a promising paradigm for robot learning. To be effective, action learning should not be limited to direct replication of movements obtained during training but must also enable the generation of actions in situations a robot has never encountered before. This paper describes a methodology that enables the generalization of the available sensorimotor knowledge. New actions are synthesized by the application of statistical methods, where the goal and other characteristics of an action are utilized as queries to create a suitable control policy, taking into account the current state of the world. Nonlinear dynamic systems are employed as a motor representation. The proposed approach enables the generation of a wide range of policies without requiring an expert to modify the underlying representations to account for different task-specific features and perceptual feedback. The paper also demonstrates that the proposed methodology can be integrated with an active vision system of a humanoid robot. 3-D vision data are used to provide query points for statistical generalization. While 3-D vision on humanoid robots with complex oculomotor systems is often difficult due to the modeling uncertainties, we show that these uncertainties can be accounted for by the proposed approach.},

Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

We show that this results in a general, common framework also connected to pol-icy gradient methods and yielding a novel algorithm for policy learning that is particularly well-suited for dynamic motor primitives. The resulting algorithm is an EM-inspired algorithm applicable to complex motor learning tasks. We compare this algorithm to several well-known parametrized policy search methods and show that it outperforms them.

Abstract—Physical contact events often allow a natural decom-position of manipulation tasks into action phases and subgoals. Within the motion primitive paradigm, each action phase cor-responds to a motion primitive, and the subgoals correspond to the goal parameters of these primitives. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms are able to efficiently and robustly optimize the parameters of motion primitives in very high-dimensional problems. These algorithms usually consider only shape parameters, which determine the trajectory between the start-and end-point of the movement. In manipulation however, it is also crucial to optimize the goal parameters, which represent the subgoals between the motion primitives. We therefore extend the Policy Improvement through Path Integrals (PI 2) algorithm to simultaneously optimize shape and goal parameters. Applying simultaneous shape and goal learning to sequences of motion primitives leads to the novel algorithm PI 2 SEQ. We use goal learning and reinforcement learning with se-quences of motion primitives to address a fundamental challenge in manipulation: improving the robustness of everyday pick-and-place tasks.},

	abstract = {Dexterous manipulation with a highly redundant movement system is one of the hallmarks of human motor skills. From numerous behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to operational space control, this paper focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also some new variants of operational space controllers. We address formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels. First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm with several benchmark tasks. As an aside, we also introduce a novel parameter estimation algorithm for rigid body dynamics, which ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that one of the simplified acceleration-based approaches can be advantageous in terms of task performance, ease of parameter tuning, and general robustness and compliance in the face of inevitable modeling errors.},

Our learning approach is based on the key observations that learning an inverse of a non uniquely invertible function can be accomplished by augmenting the input representation to the inverse model and by using a spatially localized learning ap-proach. We apply this strategy to inverse kinemat-ics learning and demonstrate how a recently developed statistical learning algorithm, Locally Weighted Projec-tion Regression, allows efficient learning of inverse kine-matic mappings in an incremental fashion even when input spaces become rather high dimensional.

It is well suited for robotics as it can cope with high-dimensional state and action spaces, one of the main challenges in robot learning. We review recent successes of both model-free and model-based policy search in robot learning. Model-free policy search is a general approach to learn policies based on sampled trajectories. We classify model-free methods based on their policy evaluation strategy, policy update strategy, and exploration strategy and present a unified view on existing algorithms. Learning a policy is often easier than learning an accurate forward model, and, hence, model-free methods are more frequently used in practice. However, for each sampled trajectory, it is necessary to interact with the robot, which can be time consuming and challenging in practice. Model-based policy search addresses this problem by first learning a simulator of the robot's dynamics from data. Subsequently, the simulator generates trajectories that are used for policy learning. For both model-free and model-based policy search methods, we review their respective properties and their applicability to robotic systems.},

A theory of control, planning, learning, and imitation with movement primitives seems to be crucial in order to reduce the search space during motor learning and achieve a large level of autonomy and flexibility in dynamically changing environments. Movement recognition based on the same representations as used for movement generation, i.e., movement primitives, is equally intimately tied into these research questions. This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for motor control with movement primitives using a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formu- lation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic movement plans. Model-based control theory is used to convert such movement plans into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, online modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution — indeed, DMPs form complete kinematic control policies, not just a particular desired trajectory. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstrations. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria, including situations with delayed rewards.

@article{Pastor2013,
	abstract = {In recent years, research on movement primitives has gained increasing popularity. The original goals of movement primitives are based on the desire to have a sufficiently rich and abstract representation for movement generation, which allows for efficient teaching, trial-and-error learning, and generalization of motor skills (Schaal 1999). Thus, motor skills in robots should be acquired in a natural dialog with humans, e.g., by imitation learning and shaping, while skill refinement and generalization should be accomplished autonomously by the robot. Such a scenario resembles the way we teach children and connects to the bigger question of how the human brain accomplishes skill learning. In this paper, we review how a particular computational approach to movement primitives, called dynamic movement primitives, can contribute to learning motor skills. We will address imitation learning, generalization, trial-and-error learning by reinforcement learning, movement recognition, and control based on movement primitives. But we also want to go beyond the standard goals of movement primitives. The stereotypical movement generation with movement primitives entails predicting of sensory events in the environment. Indeed, all the sensory events associated with a movement primitive form an associative skill memory that has the potential of forming a most powerful representation of a complete motor skill. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This review investigates two recent developments in artificial intelligence and neural computation: learning from imitation and the development of humanoid robots. It is postulated that the study of imitation learning offers a promising route to gain new insights into mechanisms of perceptual motor control that could ultimately lead to the creation of autonomous humanoid robots. Imitation learning focuses on three important issues: efficient motor learning, the connection between action and perception, and modular motor control in the form of movement primitives. It is reviewed here how research on representations of, and functional connections between, action and perception have contributed to our understanding of motor acts of other beings. The recent discovery that some areas in the primate brain are active during both movement perception and execution has provided a hypothetical neural basis of imitation. Computational approaches to imitation learning are also described, initially from the perspective of traditional Al and robotics, but also from the perspective of neural network models and statistical-learning research. Parallels and differences between biological and computational approaches to imitation are highlighted and an overview of current projects that actually employ imitation learning for humanoid robots is given.},

	abstract = {When describing robot motion with dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), goal (trajectory endpoint), shape and temporal scaling parameters are used. In reinforcement learning with DMPs, usually goals and temporal scaling parameters are predefined and only the weights for shaping a DMP are learned. Many tasks, however, exist where the best goal position is not a priori known, requiring to learn it. Thus, here we specifically address the question of how to simultaneously combine goal and shape parameter learning. This is a difficult problem because learning of both parameters could easily interfere in a destructive way. We apply value function approximation techniques for goal learning and direct policy search methods for shape learning. Specifically, we use "policy improvement with path integrals" and "natural actor critic" for the policy search. We solve a learning-to-pour-liquid task in simulations as well as using a Pa10 robot arm. Results for learning from scratch, learning initialized by human demonstration, as well as for modifying the tool for the learned DMPs are presented. We observe that the combination of goal and shape learning is stable and robust within large parameter regimes. Learning converges quickly even in the presence of disturbances, which makes this combined method suitable for robotic applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Learning from demonstration has shown to be a suitable approach for learning control policies (CPs). However, most previous studies learn CPs from a single demonstration, which results in limited scalability and insufficient generalization toward a wide range of applications in real environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to learn highly scalable CPs of basis movement skills from multiple demonstrations. In contrast to conventional studies with a single demonstration, i.e., dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), our approach efficiently encodes multiple demonstrations by shaping a parametric-attractor landscape in a set of differential equations. Assuming a certain similarity among multiple demonstrations, our approach learns the parametric-attractor landscape by extracting a small number of common factors in multiple demonstrations. The learned CPs allow the synthesis of novel movements with novel motion styles by specifying the linear coefficients of the bases as parameter vectors without losing useful properties of the DMPs, such as stability and robustness against perturbations. For both discrete and rhythmic movement skills, we present a unified learning procedure for learning a parametric-attractor landscape from multiple demonstrations. The feasibility and highly extended scalability of DMPs are demonstrated on an actual dual-arm robot. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents a novel joining method that is based on the modification of the original dynamic movement primitive formulation. The new method can reproduce the target trajectory with high accuracy regarding both the position and the velocity profile and produces smooth and natural transitions in position space, as well as in velocity space. The properties of the method are demonstrated by its application to simulated handwriting generation, which are also shown on a robot, where an adaptive algorithm is used to learn trajectories from human demonstration. These results demonstrate that the new method is a feasible alternative for joining of movement sequences, which has a high potential for all robotics applications where trajectory joining is required. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Hogan2013,
	abstract = {Humans achieve locomotor dexterity that far exceeds the capability of modern robots, yet this is achieved despite slower actuators, imprecise sensors, and vastly slower communication. We propose that this spectacular performance arises from encoding motor commands in terms of dynamic primitives. We propose three primitives as a foundation for a comprehensive theoretical framework that can embrace a wide range of upper- and lower-limb behaviors. Building on previous work that suggested discrete and rhythmic movements as elementary dynamic behaviors, we define submovements and oscillations: as discrete movements cannot be combined with sufficient flexibility, we argue that suitably-defined submovements are primitives. As the term "rhythmic" may be ambiguous, we define oscillations as the corresponding class of primitives. We further propose mechanical impedances as a third class of dynamic primitives, necessary for interaction with the physical environment. Combination of these three classes of primitive requires care. One approach is through a generalized equivalent network: a virtual trajectory composed of simultaneous and/or sequential submovements and/or oscillations that interacts with mechanical impedances to produce observable forces and motions. Reliable experimental identification of these dynamic primitives presents challenges: identification of mechanical impedances is exquisitely sensitive to assumptions about their dynamic structure; identification of submovements and oscillations is sensitive to their assumed form and to details of the algorithm used to extract them. Some methods to address these challenges are presented. Some implications of this theoretical framework for locomotor rehabilitation are considered.},

@article{Schaal,
	abstract = {Given the continuous stream of movements that bio- logical systems exhibit in their daily activities, an ac- count for such versatility and creativity has to assume that movement sequences consist of segments, exe- cuted either in sequence or with partial or complete overlap. Therefore, a fundamental question that has pervaded research in motor control both in artificial and biological systems revolves around identifying movement primitives (a.k.a. units of actions, basis behaviors, motor schemas, etc.). What are the funda- mental building blocks that are strung together, adapted to, and created for ever new behaviors? This paper summarizes results that led to the hypothesis of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP). DMPs are units of action that are formalized as stable nonlinear attractor systems. They are useful for autonomous ro- botics as they are highly flexible in creating complex rhythmic (e.g., locomotion) and discrete (e.g., a ten- nis swing) behaviors that can quickly be adapted to the inevitable perturbations of a dynamically chang- ing, stochastic environment. Moreover, DMPs pro- vide a formal framework that also lends itself to in- vestigations in computational neuroscience. A recent finding that allows creating DMPs with the help of well-understood statistical learning methods has ele- vated DMPs from a more heuristic to a principled modeling approach. Theoretical insights, evaluations on a humanoid robot, and behavioral and brain im- aging data will serve to outline the framework of DMPs for a general approach to motor control in ro- botics and biology.},

@article{Schaal2007,
	abstract = {In the past, computational motor control has been approached from at least two major frameworks: the dynamic systems approach and the viewpoint of optimal control. The dynamic system approach emphasizes motor control as a process of self-organization between an animal and its environment. Nonlinear differential equations that can model entrainment and synchronization behavior are among the most favorable tools of dynamic systems modelers. In contrast, optimal control approaches view motor control as the evolutionary or development result of a nervous system that tries to optimize rather general organizational principles, e.g., energy consumption or accurate task achievement. Optimal control theory is usually employed to develop appropriate theories. Interestingly, there is rather little interaction between dynamic systems and optimal control modelers as the two approaches follow rather different philosophies and are often viewed as diametrically opposing. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to motor control that offers a unifying modeling framework for both dynamic systems and optimal control approaches. In discussions of several behavioral experiments and some theoretical and robotics studies, we demonstrate how our computational ideas allow both the representation of self-organizing processes and the optimization of movement based on reward criteria. Our modeling framework is rather simple and general, and opens opportunities to revisit many previous modeling results from this novel unifying view. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
